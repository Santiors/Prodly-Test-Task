Test task:
API Automation with Java and Rest Assured assessment 

In GitHub:
Create a repository in GitHub.
Create a second branch from main .
Create an empty CSV file in main. 

In your sample project:
Create the relevant classes and methods that will use Java and Rest Assured to perform the following test:

Construct a list of n records (n should accept any integer value) of an object called Company which has the following fields: Name, Number of Employees, Number of Customers and Country (feel free to set random or other values for each field as the records are generated).

Call GitHub to insert your records into the CSV you created in main.

Call GitHub to merge main into your second branch. 

Call GitHub to get the records that are in the CSV that is located in your second branch. 

Assert that both files contain the same number of records.

Assert that all of the fields contain the same values in both files.

Throw a relevant error in case an assertion is not true.
